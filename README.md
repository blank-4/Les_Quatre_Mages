# _blank's End of Year project

## How ?
- You'll have to create a team of 3 developers.
- Then tackle this assignment, and specify your teams : [https://classroom.github.com/g/cFIro3Nq](https://classroom.github.com/g/cFIro3Nq). 
- Code and push regularly on GitHub.
- __We will review the master branch on the last commit before the due dates.__

## Due dates
- You will have to deliver a first (static, front-end only) version of the project _BEFORE_ __Friday 6th, March 2019, 23:59__. No functionality is required, only the design of the front-end (style, animations, pages, etc.).
- The code and documentation in their final versions have to be delivered _BEFORE_ __Friday 7th, June 2019, 23:59__.

## Purpose
This assigment has been created to test all the knowledge and skills you acquired during _blank. Thus, you'll have to create a web app from scratch following the given specs.
Improving your project beyond instructions will be greatly appreciated and rewarded with Bonus Points (complex features, improved UI/UX, hosting, etc.).

## Oral exam
You will have to defend your project in front of a jury. During this exam, you will have to :
- Shortly introduce the context
- Make a live demo of the website
- Describe how your technical choices satisfy the needs
- Develop problems encountered and how you solved them
- Conclude

This oral exam will take place on __Monday 10th, June 2019 between 10am and 1pm__. You will have __20min__ to defend your project, and the jury will have __20min__ to ask your group questions.

## Seeking help
Each group is allowed to ask five questions to teachers. To do this, email directly one of us, or message us on the chat.
